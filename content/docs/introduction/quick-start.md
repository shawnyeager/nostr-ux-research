Choose your path based on how much time you have:

---

## If you have 5 minutes

Browse the [pattern summaries](../../patterns/) to understand the critical issues facing Nostr UX.

**Quick takeaway:** Focus on getting users to value fast, showing them good content, and making core actions reliable.

---

## If you have 30 minutes

Pick the pattern that matches your biggest pain point:

- **Users abandon during signup?** → [Pattern 1: Onboarding](../../patterns/01-onboarding)
- **Empty feeds after signup?** → [Pattern 2: Content Discovery](../../patterns/02-content-discovery)
- **Posts disappearing?** → [Pattern 3: Core Interactions](../../patterns/03-core-interactions)
- **App feels slow/crashy?** → [Pattern 4: Performance](../../patterns/04-performance)
- **Users overwhelmed by settings?** → [Pattern 5: Progressive Complexity](../../patterns/05-progressive-complexity)
- **Data loss when switching clients?** → [Pattern 6: Cross-Client Consistency](../../patterns/06-cross-client-consistency)

Each pattern includes concrete examples, anti-patterns to avoid, and validation checklists.

## If you're building from scratch

Read patterns **in order (1-6)**. Each builds on principles from earlier patterns.

Start with:
1. [Foundation](../../foundation/) - Learn the validation framework
2. [Pattern 1: Onboarding](../../patterns/01-onboarding) - Get users to value quickly
3. [Pattern 2: Content Discovery](../../patterns/02-content-discovery) - Show them good content
4. Work through remaining patterns as you add features

---

## If you want to see the evidence

Check the [Research Methodology](../../research/methodology/) and [References](../../research/references) to see the 100+ sources backing these patterns.

**Research foundation:**
- Academic HCI research on social media UX
- Industry design systems (Apple HIG, Material Design)
- Nostr-specific data (retention metrics, user complaints)
- Mainstream app case studies (TikTok, Instagram, Bluesky, Discord)

## Next Steps

1. **Browse the patterns** that match your current priorities
2. **Learn the [Validation Framework](../../foundation/validation-framework)** to make better feature decisions
3. **Apply the [Implementation Guide](../../implementation/)** to integrate these patterns
4. **Join the discussion** on Nostr (search for #NostrUX)
5. **Share feedback** by opening issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/shawnyeager/nostr-ux-research)

*Remember: You don't have to implement everything at once. Pick one pattern, validate it works, then move to the next.*
