## The Problem

Nostr is struggling with user retention:
- **0%** 30-day retention for recent cohorts
- **15-20 min** onboarding time drives abandonment
- **5-6** clients needed to work around bugs

Users are abandoning before they reach value. The root cause isn't the protocol—it's UX.

## The Solution

Six research-backed patterns that address the highest-impact problems:

1. **Onboarding** - Get users to value in under 2 minutes
2. **Content Discovery** - Solve the empty feed problem
3. **Core Interactions** - Make basic actions reliable
4. **Performance** - Feel fast even when slow
5. **Progressive Complexity** - Hide advanced features from beginners
6. **Cross-Client Consistency** - Don't lose data when switching apps

## The Validation Framework

Before building any feature, ask:

1. **Does this help users accomplish their core goal?**
2. **Have we validated this solves a real problem?**
3. **Can we measure if it's working?**

**Core principle:** Great UX is the gateway to the protocol's power.
