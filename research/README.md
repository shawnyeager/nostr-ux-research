# Research Evidence Files

This directory contains verified evidence files that support the pattern documentation in this study.

---

## Purpose

These are **raw evidence collections** that inform the pattern documents and master bibliography. They represent the source material gathered during research, before being synthesized into the final patterns.

**Distinction:**
- `research/` = Raw evidence files with verified citations
- `appendices/` = Polished documentation and deep-dive analysis
- `patterns/` = Final deliverable pattern documents

---

## Citation Policy

**All findings must have verifiable URLs or be removed.**

Every claim in these files includes:
- Direct quote or specific finding
- Source URL (must be accessible)
- Date of publication/access
- Context and relevance

This strict policy ensures all research is traceable and verifiable.
